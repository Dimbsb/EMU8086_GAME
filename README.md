"Random Rectangle Blinker in x86 Assembly"

# x86 Assembly Random Rectangle Color Blinker

This project is an x86 assembly program that runs in 16-bit real mode, using BIOS interrupts and direct video memory access to create a graphical application in VGA Mode 13h (320x200 pixels, 256 colors). The program randomly paints 9 different rectangular regions on the screen with random colors and provides a blinking effect by alternating between painting the rectangles and clearing them (painting them black).

## Features
- **Random Rectangle Selection:** The program randomly selects one of 9 predefined rectangular positions on the screen.
- **Random Colors:** Each selected rectangle is filled with a random color generated by a simple pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on a linear congruential generator (LCG) formula.
- **Blinking Effect:** After painting a rectangle, the program waits for a short delay, then clears the rectangle (paints it black) to create a blinking effect.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Pressing the spacebar pauses the blinking effect. Pressing it again resumes the effect.
- **Exit Functionality:** Pressing the `q` key exits the program.

## How It Works
The program operates in VGA Mode 13h, allowing for direct pixel manipulation through the video memory segment `0xA000`. A simple PRNG is used to generate random numbers for both the rectangle positions and their colors.

- **PRNG Algorithm:** The pseudo-random numbers are generated using the formula `seed = (seed * 0x8403) + 1`, a common linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm.
- **Rectangle Positions:** The positions of the 9 rectangles are hardcoded in memory, each with a width of 105 pixels and a height of 66 pixels. Random selection of these positions is driven by the PRNG.
- **Color Randomization:** Colors are randomly selected from the 256-color palette available in VGA Mode 13h. Each rectangle is painted using a randomly generated color.

## Controls
- **Spacebar:** Toggles the pause and resume of the blinking effect.
- **'q' Key:** Exits the program.

## Prerequisites
This program requires an x86 emulator or real hardware capable of running 16-bit DOS applications. Examples of environments where this program can be run include:
- DOSBox
- Bochs
- QEMU
- Real DOS environment on a compatible x86 machine

## Compilation and Execution

### Assemble and Link
To assemble and link the program using `NASM` and `TASM`:
```bash
nasm -f bin -o program.com program.asm
